In the next video we will create a new Django project using Docker.

Some Linux users have mentioned that they see the following error in the following video:

If you see this error, this is because of a known issue with Docker on Linux: https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/2259

Unfortunately I have not found a perfect solution, however a good workaround is as follows:

1. Update your docker-compose.yaml file to include user: $UID:$GID in the app service like this: https://gist.github.com/LondonAppDev/93f84cc9b86c0f513a18c70571af208a#file-docker-compose-yml-L5

2. Change the ownership of your app/ directory to your user by running chown -R $(whoami):$(whoami) app/

3. Now run export UID=${UID} && export GID=${GID} in the terminal to set your UID and GID variables (if you don't do this then you'll see a warning saying these values were not set when running docker).

4. Run the command again: docker-compose run app sh -c "django-admin.py startproject app .".

You should see that is works and the project is created with the correct permissions.

The drawback / issue with this solution is that step 3 needs to be ran every time you load a new terminal window. There are a few workarounds to this.

One is adding the export lines to your .bash_profile file so they are ran automatically each time you start a new terminal.

If you have any issues with the above workaround, please message me in the Q&A and include a link to your full source code on GitHub.
